# Your Task

There is an API http://stacked.com.ng to register, login and view profile. You need to:

- Build a registration page that consumes the /api/register route
- Build a login page which makes a request to the /api/login route after successful registration.
- On login/registration, the user should be redirected to a profile page which will call the /api/profile endpoint and display the user profile

## Considerations

You may want to consider:

- How do we handle form validation?
- What do we do on the /profile page if the token is invalid?
- What if a customer is already logged in on the login page?
- How do we logout?
- How presentable are the screens?

These considerations are time-permitting - you are not expected to action all of them.
